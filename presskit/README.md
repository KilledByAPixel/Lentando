Lentando Launches: A Private, Judgment-Free Habit and Substance Use Tracker Built for Real Life
New open-source web app puts harm reduction first — no accounts, no ads, no shame

AUSTIN, TX — Lentando, a new habit and substance use tracker built around harm reduction, is now available as a free installable web app at lentando.3d2k.com. Lentando helps people log use, track urges resisted, and recognize healthy actions in a calm, practical way, without judgment.

Unlike most tracking apps, Lentando is local-first by default. Your data stays in your browser and the app works offline. If you want cross-device syncing, you can opt in to creating an account, but nothing is required to get started.

"Recovery isn't a race. Progress is personal, and often non-linear," said creator Frank Force, Lentando President/Janitor. "Lentando is built to meet people where they are. Whether they're aiming for abstinence, tapering, or just trying to understand their own patterns. Every small win counts."

Calm, Easy, and Free

Lentando is intentionally lightweight and friction free. Logging a session, a resisted urge, or a healthy action takes a single tap, lowering the barrier to consistent tracking. The app includes visual trends that highlight timing, amounts, and day-by-day patterns, plus 50+ badges that recognize progress in many forms, including gaps, streaks, mindful choices, and milestones.
Healthy actions are built in as simple resets anyone can use, such as drinking water, breathing exercises, movement, tidying up, and stepping outside.

Key features:
One-tap logging for use, urges resisted, and healthy actions
Visual analytics for timing, amounts, and day-by-day patterns
50+ badges for milestones, streaks, gaps, and mindful choices
Local-first privacy with full offline support and optional cloud sync
Installable PWA on phone, tablet, and desktop
Open Source Under GPLv3

Lentando is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3), allowing anyone to use, study, modify, and share the software under the same license terms.

Availability

Lentando is available now at lentando.3d2k.com and can be installed directly to your home screen via PWA support. You can create an account anytime to sync data between devices.
