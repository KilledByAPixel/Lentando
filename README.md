## Why Lentando? 🐢

Recovery isn't a race-it's a journey taken one step at a time. Like a turtle, steady progress wins over speed. Lentando helps you track substance use, resisted urges, and healthy habits without shame or judgment.

Whether you're working toward complete abstinence, harm reduction, or just understanding your patterns better, Lentando meets you where you are.

**Every small win counts.**
